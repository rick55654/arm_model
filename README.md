# Arm_model
This repository contains two URDF models for robotic arms: Xarm and Learm. It includes ROS 2 launch files to visualize the robot models using joint_state_publisher_gui, allowing interactive control of the arm joints. Users can easily launch either robot in a simulated interface with GUI-based joint manipulation.
